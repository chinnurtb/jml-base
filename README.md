Jeremy's Machine Learning Library (base part)

This library contains a system layer that exposes much functionality that
wasn't readily available at the time the library was first built (1999) for
things like multi threading, linear algebra, and much else.  Most of this
functionality is now available in modern, maintained packages (like Boost)
and is being gradually replaced by its more modern equivalents.


Currently, many of the source files mention the Affero GPL version 3.
These references will eventually be changed; the library as a whole is made
available under the Apache License, version 2 (the text of the library is
below).

Note that the library incorporates the Judy Arrays library from HP; that
library is made available under the LGPL license by HP and is *not*
covered by the Apache License.
